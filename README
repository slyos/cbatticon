A GTK+ battery icon which uses libacpi to be lightweight and fast.
Requires libnotify, libacpi, and GTK+ to build.

libnotify download page (near the bottom): http://www.galago-project.org/downloads.php 
libacpi download page: http://www.ngolde.de/libacpi.html

Run make and it should compile if you have all the previous dependecies.
Will add an install option soon.

Command line arguments:
Most of these are available by typing in ./cbatticon -h
